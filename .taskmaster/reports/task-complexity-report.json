		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup logging dependencies and basic infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of logging dependencies into discrete steps: adding crate dependencies, creating module structure, verifying clap features, and establishing the foundation. Focus on ensuring each dependency is properly configured and the module structure follows Rust conventions.",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity - primarily involves adding dependencies to Cargo.toml and creating basic module structure. Well-defined scope with clear deliverables and straightforward implementation."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement log file management and rotation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide log file management into specific implementation areas: directory creation with error handling, file rotation logic implementation, integration with tracing-appender, disk space management, and comprehensive error handling that crashes appropriately. Each subtask should handle a specific aspect of file management.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to file system operations, error handling requirements, rotation logic, and integration with external crates. Requires careful handling of edge cases and system-level operations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Design and implement structured logging API",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure the logging API implementation into: macro definition and implementation, structured context support, timestamp configuration, and API design validation. Focus on creating an intuitive developer experience while leveraging tracing's capabilities effectively.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity involving macro system understanding, tracing integration, and API design. Requires knowledge of Rust macros and careful consideration of developer ergonomics."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement command line argument parsing for logging configuration",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down CLI argument parsing into: extending existing CLI structure, implementing specific logging flags, integrating with clap derive macros, and ensuring compatibility with both REPL and file execution modes. Each subtask should focus on a specific aspect of argument handling.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-low complexity involving extending existing CLI parsing. Well-defined requirements but needs integration with existing systems and handling of different execution modes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Configure logging initialization and output formatting",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide logging initialization into: early initialization in main function, text format configuration, JSON format implementation, conditional console output setup, and error handling for initialization failures. Focus on ensuring robust initialization across different execution modes.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to multiple output formats, conditional logic, integration with previous tasks, and need to handle both REPL and script execution modes. Critical integration point for the entire logging system."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Replace print statements in compiler module",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize compiler module migration by: scanning and inventory of existing print statements, replacing statements in scanner.rs, replacing statements in parser.rs, and replacing statements in compiler.rs with appropriate contextual information. Each subtask should focus on one module to ensure thorough coverage.",
			"reasoning": "Medium complexity requiring systematic code review, understanding of compiler internals, and appropriate log level selection. Needs careful testing to ensure no functionality changes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Replace print statements in VM module",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure VM module migration into: inventory of existing print statements, replacing statements in vm.rs execution logic, adding contextual logging for stack operations, implementing logging for function calls/returns, and performance validation. Focus on maintaining VM performance while adding comprehensive logging.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity due to performance considerations, VM execution criticality, and need for detailed contextual information. Requires deep understanding of VM internals and careful performance testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Complete migration and add contextual logging to remaining modules",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Complete the migration through: comprehensive audit of remaining print statements, migrating main.rs and REPL functionality, adding logging to error handling systems, implementing logging for memory management and GC, adding logging for native function calls, and final verification with performance testing. Ensure complete coverage of all identified logging areas.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity as it's a comprehensive cleanup task covering multiple modules, requires performance validation, and serves as the final integration point. Needs thorough testing across all code paths and performance verification."
