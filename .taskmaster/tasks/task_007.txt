# Task ID: 7
# Title: Add Recursive Closure Detection and Error Handling
# Status: cancelled
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement detection and proper error handling for recursive closure attempts
# Details:
Add recursive closure detection to compiler and VM. Implement checks during closure creation to detect when a closure tries to capture itself directly or indirectly. Raise VMError with clear message when recursive closure is attempted. Add cycle detection algorithm to traverse upvalue chains and identify circular references. Ensure error is caught at compile time when possible, runtime otherwise.

# Test Strategy:
Test direct recursive closure attempts, test indirect recursive closures through multiple levels, verify clear error messages, test performance impact of cycle detection
