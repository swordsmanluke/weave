# Task ID: 6
# Title: Add Mutable Upvalue Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enable modification of captured variables within closures with proper reference sharing
# Details:
Implement mutable upvalue support using Rc<RefCell<WeaveValue>> for shared mutable access. Modify SetUpvalue opcode to handle mutable references correctly. Ensure multiple closures capturing the same variable can all modify it and see changes. Implement proper borrowing semantics to prevent runtime panics. Add counter example functionality where closure can increment captured variable state.

# Test Strategy:
Test counter closure example, verify multiple closures sharing mutable upvalue, test state persistence across closure calls, validate no borrowing conflicts
