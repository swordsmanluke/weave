# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Test Suite
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create complete test coverage for nested closures including edge cases and integration scenarios
# Details:
Implement comprehensive test suite covering all closure scenarios. Add functional tests for basic nested closures (outer(1)(2)(3) example), function-scoped variable capture, closures capturing other closures, and closures created in loops. Add edge case tests for maximum nesting depth, multiple closures sharing upvalues. Add integration tests for closures with built-in functions, REPL interaction, and data structure storage. Ensure all existing single-level closure tests continue to pass.

# Test Strategy:
Functional test coverage >95%, edge case validation, integration test suite, regression testing for existing functionality, performance validation
