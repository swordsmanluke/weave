# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement File I/O System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 23, 22, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add open(), read(), write() builtin functions with support for :csv, :json, :yaml, :toml, :ini file formats and custom parser functions
# Details:
Implement comprehensive file I/O system for the Weave language: 1) Add native file operations - create open(filename, mode) function returning file handle, read(handle) and read(filename) for file content reading, write(handle, data) and write(filename, data) for file writing, close(handle) for resource cleanup. 2) Implement format-specific parsing with symbol-based format specifiers - add :csv parser using comma-separated value parsing with configurable delimiters, :json parser with proper JSON syntax validation and nested object/array support, :yaml parser handling indentation and multi-document files, :toml parser for configuration files with section support, :ini parser with section/key-value pair handling. 3) Create WeaveFile type in types/ directory - implement file handle management with proper resource cleanup using RAII patterns, add file metadata access (size, permissions, timestamps), support both text and binary modes. 4) Add file system operations - create directory listing, file existence checking, path manipulation functions. 5) Implement streaming for large files - add chunked reading to prevent memory exhaustion, support line-by-line iteration for text processing. 6) Add error handling for file operations with descriptive error messages for common scenarios (file not found, permission denied, disk full). 7) Integrate with container system for structured data - ensure parsed formats return appropriate WeaveContainer structures for lists and maps.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive test suite for file I/O functionality: 1) Basic file operations tests - verify open/read/write/close cycle with various file modes, test file handle resource management and cleanup. 2) Format parser tests for each supported format - create sample CSV, JSON, YAML, TOML, and INI files, verify correct parsing into WeaveContainer structures, test edge cases like empty files, malformed syntax, and nested structures. 3) Error handling tests - verify appropriate error messages for file not found, permission errors, and invalid format syntax. 4) Integration tests with container system - ensure file I/O works seamlessly with list and map operations, test round-trip serialization (write then read) preserves data integrity. 5) Performance tests for large file handling - verify streaming works correctly for files larger than available memory, test chunked reading performance. 6) File system operation tests - verify directory listing, file existence checking, and path manipulation functions work across different operating systems.
