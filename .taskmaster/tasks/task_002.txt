# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement Upvalue Chain Resolution
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create mechanism to resolve upvalues through multiple scope levels for nested closures
# Details:
Implement upvalue linking system in VM to traverse call stack for nested closure upvalue resolution. Add upvalue chain tracking to CallFrame structure. When resolving upvalue, walk through parent frames to find the correct variable binding. Follow Crafting Interpreters approach adapted for Rust - maintain chain of upvalue references that can traverse multiple nesting levels. Ensure O(1) resolution after initial capture setup.

# Test Strategy:
Test nested closure scenarios like outer(1)(2)(3), verify upvalue resolution through multiple scope levels, validate performance with deeply nested closures
