# Title: Fix parser precedence bug preventing function calls in binary expressions from generating Op::Call instructions
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Debug and fix the parser precedence issue where function calls within binary expressions fail to generate proper Op::Call bytecode instructions, causing runtime execution failures.
# Details:
Investigate the parser's precedence handling in parser.rs to identify why function calls embedded in binary expressions (e.g., `foo() + bar()` or `x + func(y)`) are not generating Op::Call instructions. The issue likely stems from precedence rules incorrectly parsing function calls as identifiers when they appear as operands in binary expressions. Review the Pratt parser implementation, specifically the precedence table and how function call parsing interacts with binary operator parsing. Check if the issue occurs during the primary expression parsing phase or during binary expression resolution. Examine the parse_call method and ensure it's properly invoked when a function call is encountered as part of a larger expression. Debug by adding logging to track when Op::Call instructions should be emitted versus when they're being skipped. Verify that function calls work correctly in isolation but fail within binary expressions. Fix the precedence rules or parsing logic to ensure function calls are properly recognized and compiled to Op::Call instructions regardless of their position in binary expressions.

# Test Strategy:
Create test cases for function calls in various binary expression contexts: `func() + 5`, `10 * func(x)`, `func1() + func2()`, and nested scenarios like `(func() + 5) * func2()`. Add unit tests that compile these expressions and verify Op::Call instructions are present in the generated bytecode. Test both with existing functions and lambdas. Create integration tests that execute these expressions and verify correct runtime behavior. Add debug output to track bytecode generation and ensure Op::Call instructions appear at expected positions. Verify existing function call tests continue to pass.
