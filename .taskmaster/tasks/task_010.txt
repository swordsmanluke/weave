# Task ID: 10
# Title: Documentation and REPL Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Update documentation and ensure proper REPL support for nested closures
# Details:
Update project documentation to reflect new nested closure capabilities. Ensure REPL properly handles closure display (showing identifier when not invoked, evaluating when called). Update language examples and usage documentation. Verify closure integration with built-in functions like puts(). Test REPL interaction patterns with nested closures. Update any existing code comments and inline documentation to reflect new implementation details.

# Test Strategy:
REPL interaction tests, documentation accuracy review, integration with built-in functions validation, example code verification
